    <h1>Welcome to my AI Detection Study</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Lukas Schaffrath, and I study Cognitive, Digital, and Empirical English Studies at RWTH Aachen University.
        Since I was a teacher trainee for several years beforehand, and the topic of AI-generated texts has become increasingly relevant in education, 
        I became interested in understanding how well university instructors can distinguish between human-written and AI-generated student essays.
        This study aims to explore this question and gather insights into the detectability of AI in academic writing.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this study, you will be asked to classify a series of student essays as either <strong>AI-generated</strong> or <strong>human-written</strong>.
        Your task is to rely on your professional judgment and expertise in evaluating written texts.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be shown 10 excerpts from BA/MA student essays from RWTH Aachen University: 5 of them are generated by an AI and 5 are human-written.
        The order of presentation is randomized for each participant.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each text, please indicate your classification and rate your confidence on a scale from 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very confident). 
        Take your time to read each text carefully; your response time will also be recorded for analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your participation is voluntary, and the responses are anonymous except for the basic demographic data you provide.
